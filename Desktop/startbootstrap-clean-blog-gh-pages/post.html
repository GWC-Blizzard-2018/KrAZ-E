                Each year, approximately 15 million girls under the age of 18 are forced into marriage.

Many of them are forced to marry men much older than they are...

                Rajni Devi liked school and had big dreams. She was not going to end up like so many other girls in India: married off as a child bride.
Rajni was 14 years old when her mother told her she must get married, but she refused. She was determined to stay in school, and she wasn't ready to be a mother yet.
However, for a girl in rural India, it wasn't as simple as just saying no...

                The smells and colors—bold yellow turmeric smeared on hands and faces, a strip of red powdered vermillion applied to the hairline—offer the first clues that a wedding is about to happen or has just happened. The girls at this event are often too young to understand marriage, but they’re old enough to know what the spices being ceremoniously applied to their bodies signify...           </h5>

                Child marriages are declining, with the largest drop in South Asia, according to UNICEF.

A UNICEF release Tuesday attributed the progress in India to increasing rates of girls' education, government investments and public messaging around the illegality of child marriage...          </h5>
